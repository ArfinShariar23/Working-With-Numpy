In this Repository I will add My Some Numpy Work File Work File 

What is Numpy?

-Numpy Stands for Numerical Python.

-A Python Package for Scientific Computing like
   * Discrete Fourier Transform
   * Basic Linear Algebra
   * Basic Statical Operations
   
   
Why Numpy?

 - It's Fast
 
 - It's Need Less Memory
 
 - The core of the numpy package is the ndarray object.
 
 
How Numpy Represent any Array: 

1D Array
------------------
1  |  2 | 9 | 10 |
------------------
AXIS = 0
Shape = (4,)

2D Array
-----------------
5.2 | 3.0 | 4.5 |
----------------- 
9.1 | 0.1 | 0.3 |
-----------------

There will be 2 axis in 2D Array
Axis = 0 { up -down }
Axis = 1 { right - left}
Shape = (2,3)

3D Array
[Drawing Not Possible]

There will be 3 axis in 3D Array...
Axis = 0
Axis = 1
Axis = 2

Application Of Numpy:
---------------------
* Machine Learning
* Data Analysis
* Backbone of other many Python Packages

How to Install Numpy:
--------------------
S-1: Open your Searchbox
S-2: Search for Python Command Prompt
S-3 Write this following statement
     - pip install numpy
Then it will be automatically start installing in your PC.

Thank You...
